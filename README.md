# PriceCo-Sales-Analysis
An interactive Power BI dashboard built using sales data from PriceCo stores across Mexico. The dashboard explores key business questions to help increase average sales per customer using data visualization and insight discovery.

# PriceCo Sales Analysis 

## 📌 Overview
This project presents an interactive dashboard developed in Power BI to analyze 1,000 sample transactions from PriceCo, a wholesale club operating in Mexico. The objective is to uncover actionable insights to help increase the **average sales ticket value per customer visit**.

The dashboard leverages the **DPAD framework (Define, Prepare, Analyze, and Deliver)** and applies data storytelling techniques to explore patterns in customer behavior, product preferences, and city-wise sales performance.

## 📊 Research Questions Addressed
1. **Is the city of purchase related to the average sales ticket?**
2. **Are sales related to the payment method used?**
3. **Do product categories influence the total sales amount?**

Each question is analyzed on a separate page with visuals that reveal relevant patterns and relationships, particularly using the `Total_mxp` (total sale in Mexican pesos) variable.

## 📁 File Included
- `PriceCo_Sales_Analysis_Akshitha.pbix` – Power BI dashboard file

## 🔍 Dataset Description
- **Source:** PriceCo internal sample data (1,000 transactions)
- **Locations:** Mexico City, Monterrey, Guadalajara
- **Fields include:** `City`, `Customer ID`, `Product Category`, `Total_mxp`, `Payment Method`, `Transaction Date`, etc.

The dataset is visualized to check for consistency and completeness before generating insights.

## 🧠 Insights from Visuals
The “Conclusions” page in the dashboard summarizes insights from each visualization. These include:
- Identifying which cities yield higher sales on average
- Understanding which payment methods correlate with higher sales
- Highlighting product categories that contribute the most to revenue

These insights can assist PriceCo executives in developing strategies to **boost average sales per customer** by optimizing product offerings, promotional efforts, and payment experience.
